# Introduction

As a DevOps Engineer in training at Steghub, I am documenting the process of deploying a `MEAN` stack application. The `MEAN` stack is a JavaScript-based framework designed to make the development process smoother and more efficient. It includes four open-source components: **M**ongoDB, **E**xpress, **A**ngular, and **N**ode. These components provide a comprehensive framework for web developers. This documentation will detail the steps necessary to successfully deploy a `MEAN` stack application.
